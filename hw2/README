This is a simple "hello-world" example to parallel programming meant
to introduce the student to how to execute a program in a
supercomputer environment.

This is a simple program to determine the value of pi. The algorithm
suggested here is chosen for its simplicity. The method evaluates the
integral of 4/(1+x*x) between 0 and 1. The method is simple: the
integral is approximated by a sum of n intervals; the approximation to
the integral in each interval is (1/n)*4/(1+x*x). The master process
determines the number of intervals by looking at the first sysarg (cli
args); the master then broadcasts this number to all of the
other processes. Each process then adds up every n'th interval (x =
rank/n, rank/n+size/n,...). Finally, the sums computed by each process
are added together using a reduction.
